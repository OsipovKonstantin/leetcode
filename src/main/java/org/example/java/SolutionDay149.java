//    A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single
//    file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected
//    where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
//    You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each
//    heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
//    Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
//    Example 1:
//    Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
//    Output: 3
//    Explanation:
//    heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
//    expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
//    Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
//    Example 2:
//    Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
//    Output: 5
//    Explanation:
//    heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
//    expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
//    All indices do not match.
//    Example 3:
//    Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
//    Output: 0
//    Explanation:
//    heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
//    expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
//    All indices match.
